    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://uber.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Uber</a> is one of the most famous startup in the world. It started as a ride-sharing application for people who couldn't afford a taxi. Now, Uber expanded its activities to Food Delivery with <a href=\"https://www.ubereats.com/fr-en\" target=\"_blank\">Uber Eats</a>, package delivery, freight transportation and even urban transportation with <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/fr/en/ride/uber-bike/\" target=\"_blank\"> Jump Bike</a> and <a href=\"https://www.li.me/\" target=\"_blank\"> Lime </a> that the company funded. \n",

    "The company's goal is to revolutionize transportation accross the globe. It operates now on about 70 countries and 900 cities and generates over $14 billion revenue! 😮\n"

    "\n",
    "One of the main pain point that Uber's team found is that sometimes drivers are not around when users need them. For example, a user might be in San Francisco's Financial District whereas Uber drivers are looking for customers in Castro.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(If you are not familiar with the bay area, check out <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Francisco,+CA,+USA/@37.7515389,-122.4567213,13.43z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x80859a6d00690021:0x4a501367f076adff!8m2!3d37.7749295!4d-122.4194155\" target=\"_blank\">Google Maps</a>)\n",

    "Eventhough both neighborhood are not that far away, users would still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes before being picked-up, which is too long. Uber's research shows that users accept to wait 5-7 minutes, otherwise they would cancel their ride. \n",

    "### Clustering is your friend \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering technics are a perfect fit for the job. Think about it, all the pickup locations can be gathered into different clusters. You can then use **cluster coordinates to pin hot zones** 😉\n",

    "### Create maps with `plotly` \n",
    "\n",
    "Check out <a href=\"https://plotly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Plotly</a> documentation, you can create maps and populate them easily. Obviously, there are other libraries but this one should do the job pretty well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start small grow big \n",
    "\n",
    "Eventhough Uber wants to have hot-zones per hour and per day of week, you should first **start small**. Pick one day at a given hour and **then start to generalize** your approach. "
